## Functional paradigm 
### Introduction to Functional Programming
   * What is functional programming?
   * Functional vs. imperative programming
   * Advantages and disadvantages of functional programming
   * Functional programming languages (Haskell, Lisp, Scala, etc.)

### Core Concepts of Functional Programming
   * Pure Functions
      Immutability
      No side effects
      Referential transparency
   * First-class Functions
       Functions as arguments
       Functions as return values
       Functions as data structures
   * Higher-order Functions
       Map
       Filter
       Reduce (or Fold)
   * Recursion
       Recursive functions
       Tail recursion
       Accumulators

### Functional Programming Techniques
   * Lambda Functions (or Anonymous Functions)
   * Function Composition
   * Currying and Partial Application
   * Lazy Evaluation
   * Monads
   * Pattern Matching
   * Algebraic Data Types

### Functional Data Structures
   * Immutable Data Structures
       Immutable lists
       Immutable sets
       Immutable maps (or dictionaries)
   * Persistent Data Structures
       Persistent arrays
       Persistent trees
