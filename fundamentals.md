#### Special types
- Null value
- Pointers & Address

#### Operators

- Arithmetic operators: used to perform basic mathematical operations, such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (-), division (/), modulus or remainder (%), increment (++) and decrement (--).

- Assignment operators: used to assign values to variables, such as the assignment operator (=) and other compound assignment operators such as +=, -=, -=, /=, %=.

- Comparison operators: used to compare values, such as equality (==), inequality (!=), greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=) and less than or equal to (<=).

- Logical operators: used to perform Boolean operations, such as the logical operator and (&&), the logical operator or (||), and the logical negation operator (!).
Bitwise operators: used to perform bitwise operations, such as the left shift operator (<<), the right shift operator (>>), the bitwise and operator (&), the bitwise or operator (|), and the bitwise negation operator (~).

- Concatenation operators: used to concatenate character strings or values, such as the concatenation operator (+).

- Conditional operators: used to assign values to a variable based on a condition, such as the ternary conditional operator (?).

## Error Handling

### Introduction to Error Handling

- What is Error Handling?
- Importance of Error Handling in programming
- Types of errors: compile-time, runtime, and logical errors

### Basic Error Handling Techniques

- Return values and error codes
- Error handling functions and methods
- Assertions

### Exceptions

- What are exceptions?
- Exception hierarchy and built-in exceptions
- Creating custom exceptions

### Try-Catch-Finally Blocks

- The try block: capturing exceptions
- The catch block: handling exceptions
   Catching specific exceptions
   Catching multiple exceptions
- The finally block: executing code regardless of exception occurrence
- Nested try-catch-finally blocks

### Raising and Throwing Exceptions

- Raising exceptions
- Throwing exceptions

### Resource Management and Cleanup

- Proper resource allocation and deallocation
- Using with statements (context managers) for resource management

## Best Practices for Error Handling

- Defensive programming
- Handling exceptions at the appropriate level
- Providing meaningful error messages and logging
- Failing fast and early
- Testing and debugging strategies


### Message Passing and Distributed Systems

- Message Passing Interface (MPI)
- Actor Model
- Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)
- Publish-Subscribe Pattern

### Hardware and Architectures for Parallelism

- Multicore Processors
- Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)
